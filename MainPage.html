<h2> Here's just a little about me: </h2>

<p> I am from Naperville and currently live in Urbana where I attend the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My current area of study is Computer Engineering with an interest in virtual reality, mobile application development, and now most recently web development. On this website I will post some of the cool things I am working on (including this website itself). Enjoy!
