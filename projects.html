I love writing code that solves problems. You can find some of my solutions on github:

<h3> PickOne </h3>
My first Android App was a fun little game that allowed you to choose between two options (like apples vs bananas). The app would update in real time with other users responses to create a graph with the statistics of every other users votes. I worked on this project in a group with two other UIUC students. Here is the link to the github repository: <a href = "https://github.com/cyang87/PickOne2">PickOne App </a>
<h3> RPZ Testing Application </h3>
I developed this app in order to be used by a client who tests Reduced Pressure Zone (RPZ) devices for local businesses and homes in Naperville. It works as a mobile database for test records that can be easily accessed and updated in the field. You can find the written code on my github linked above.
